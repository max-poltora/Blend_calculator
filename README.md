This web app was developed as a calculator to estimate the amounts of fertilizer monocomponents to produce user-defined grade of NPK blend.

Calculator outputs depend on user-indicated components and NPKS composition as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), potash (K<sub>2</sub>O) and sulphur (S). 

The calculator allows user:
    1. To define the target NPKS grade 
    2. To define the amount of monocomponents (2, 3 or 4) 
    3. To define the use of a filler (inactive ingredient) 
    4. To choose components from the dropdown list with possibility to use up to two custom ingredients (indicated as Costom_1 and Custom_2). When using a custom component, user has to indicate the NPKS composition accordingly
    5. To input the prices of raw materials

Component prices and volumes can be specified in standard and metric units; output units are set to correspond with input units.
